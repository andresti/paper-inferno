title: Likelihood-free Inference through Sample Summary Statistics Learning
author: Pablo de Castro, Tommaso Dorigo
abstract: Complex computer simulations are commonly required for accurate
  data modelling in many scientific disciplines, making statistical
  inference challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood
  evaluation for the observed data.
  In addition, sometimes we are interested only on inference over a subset
  of the generative model parameters while taking into account the
  uncertainty or misspecification on the resulting interval estimation
  or hypothesis testing.
