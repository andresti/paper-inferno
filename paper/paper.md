title: Likelihood-free Inference through Sample Summary Statistics Learning
author: Pablo de Castro, Tommaso Dorigo
abstract: >-
  Complex computer simulations are commonly required for accurate
  data modelling in many scientific disciplines, making statistical
  inference challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood
  evaluation for the observed data.
  Furthermore, sometimes we are interested only on inference over a subset
  of the generative model parameters while taking into account model
  uncertainty or misspecification on the resulting interval estimation
  or hypothesis testing.

# Introduction

Simulator-based inference is  currently at the core of many scientific
fields, such as population genetics, epidemiology or particle physics.
In many cases the implicit generative procedure defined in the simulation is
stochastic and lacks a tractable probability density $p(x| \theta)$.
